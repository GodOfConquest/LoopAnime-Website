Would be easier to understand what Loop-Anime / Loop-Series consists if you think in it like a wrapper for the follow Bundles:

 1. **Netflix** 
	 1. Trending Shows / Series - So you know which ones to watch next
	 2. You Were Watching - You can resume your show at any time with a single click - you can stop watching one thing and go for another and come back later to see the rest of the episode !!**awesome**!!.
	 3. With your Like / Comments / Favorites and Rates we will be able to build a personalized feed for you -- so your experience in the website will be the most suitable for you and your preferences! (we will tear apart google useless searchs for "Animes like Naruto"
 2. **My Anime List** / **Trakt.tv** / **HummingBird**
	 1. Tracking System - Dont get lost between 4 episodes of 10 shows, know exactly where the next episode will come available, what have you seen and what its up to see.
	 2. Watched that, Liked that, Rated that and also left a comment / review - thats the way that a true *looper* would do!
	 3. Dont worry all our application is **compatible with this 3rd applications** - therefore you will be able to **synchronize** your looper profile with this 3rd applications with a simple click -- will reapeat myself **!! How Awesome is that !!**
 3. **Crunchy Roll**
	 1. We have an integrated APIs and Scrappers to read 3rd websites and grab links for the episodes -- if you are all purity dont stop your contribution because of that contribute in the Social Part of the project - Profiles / Tracking there is plenty other areas where you are needed!
	 2. You can watch animes provided by 3rd Applications / Parties - Whatsoever the project its not focused on that and we do not host any of those files. We are hoping that the project become something notorious and investors / companies actually give us licenses to provide the content in a clean way! Or else we can always delete that bundle later on and focus on the Social Area!

**Definition of Looper**: loopers or crazy loopers are users that lost them-selfs under the sub-under-reality of Tv-Shows / Animes - NonStop Watch provided by loop-anime and loop-series
